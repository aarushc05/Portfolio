## Projects

### [ClusterTrader](./ClusterTrader/)
> Georgia Tech CS-4641: Machine Learning — Group Final Project

A quantitative trading system that uses clustering algorithms (K-Means, GMM, Hierarchical) to group S&P 500 stocks by RSI patterns, then trains separate return prediction models per cluster. Features walk-forward cross-validation, portfolio backtesting against the S&P 500, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization.

### [ML-Exploration](./ML-Exploration/)
A personal deep-dive into machine learning fundamentals through from-scratch implementations. Includes a neural network built entirely with NumPy (forward/backprop, SiLU activation, Adam optimizer, dropout), a CNN for brain tumor classification, Random Forest with bootstrap aggregating, and RNN/LSTM models for Shakespeare text generation.
