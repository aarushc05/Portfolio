## Projects

### [language-modeling.ipynb](./language-modeling.ipynb)
> Georgia Tech CS-7650: Natural Language Processing — Assignment

Implements language models of increasing sophistication for text generation. Covers n-gram models, feed-forward neural language models, and recurrent architectures (RNN/LSTM) for learning the statistical patterns of text corpora.

### [key-value-memory-network-qa.ipynb](./key-value-memory-network-qa.ipynb)
> Georgia Tech CS-7650: Natural Language Processing — Final Project

Builds a Key-Value Memory Network for question answering over a Wikipedia biography database. Implements attention mechanisms to match natural language questions to relevant facts, learning embeddings that enable retrieval without encoding all knowledge in model parameters. Achieves 73% test accuracy on politician biography QA.
